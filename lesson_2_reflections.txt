What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When we initialize a repository with 'git init' command, it creates .git file so that it can track changes to the tracked files inside the repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
staging area is more like a intermediate stage where files are kept before they are commited to repository. It reminds of files which are waiting to be commited.
