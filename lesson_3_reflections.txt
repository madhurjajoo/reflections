When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
when you are not on your machine, you can use remote repository to access your files and make changes or for colloboration purposes.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Doing it automatically would override the changes and commits you have in local repository. So it is always safe to do pull changes manually.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
'Fork' is used to get the copy of repository from someone else's account and modify on top of it. While 'Clone' is used to get the repository from GitHub to your local machine. And 'Branch' is just to split out of existing commit within a local repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
It helps you to compare the local and remote state of repository instantly and you can track the changes.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Using Git and GitHub is definitely way easier that doing the changes when two or more are working on same file/s. 

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
when one make new changes which are not ready or approved it is good idea to make those changes in new branch so that master version, which is working version stays intact. So when changes get approved can be merged. Also it helps when someone else make changes on same file using different branch, we can merge changes manually later.
